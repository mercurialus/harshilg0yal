# Hey there, I'm Harshil! 👋

I'm a student at [IIT Hyderabad](https://www.iith.ac.in/) pursuing a B.Tech in Mathematics & Computing. I like to think of myself as a code whisperer—transforming complex problems into elegant solutions (with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of nerdiness).

## 🧠 About Me

- 💻 **Tech Enthusiast:** From blockchain data trading to custom network tools and precision calculators, I love exploring different realms of technology.
- 🎯 **Problem Solver:** Whether it's optimizing algorithms or building a calculator that handles 1000+ digit arithmetic, I’m always up for a challenge.
- 🤝 **Team Player:** Currently leading the tech squad at IIT Hyderabad’s cybersec club, where we hack away at CTFs and host events that are only mildly chaotic.
- 🧩 **Cubing:** Trying my hand at speedcubing, but for now... I’m just cubing.
- 🏓 **Table Tennis:** I enjoy fast rallies and friendly banter with my TT buddy.
- 🚶‍♂️ **Long Walks Enthusiast:** Nothing beats a good walk to clear your head (and secretly debug that one nasty bug).

## 🛠️ Projects Worth Peeking At

- 🔗 **Data Trading & Traceability on Blockchain:**  
  Implemented backward watermark-chain scheme on Ethereum + IPFS, tokenized datasets as NFTs.

<!-- 
- 📈 **HFT-X – High-Frequency Trading Simulator:**  
  Built a real-time C++ trading engine with multithreaded order flows, Monte Carlo pricing, and Bayesian strategy switching.

- 🔥 **Neural Diffusion Inversion:**  
  Trained deep models to reverse-engineer initial states from final outcomes of PDEs. U-Net + PyTorch magic.
-->

- 🧮 **Infinite Precision Calculator:**  
  CLI calculator with 1000+ digit BigInt & BigFloat support. Karatsuba multiplication and FFT included (because speed matters).

- 🕵️ **ARPie – Network Packet Sniffer & Simulator:**  

  Real-time packet analysis + spoofing for security testing. Built using Pcap++ with high-speed packet floods.<br>
  😴 Currently surviving on caffeine and curiosity, building more projects that might just be worth losing sleep over. If you're up for a collab (or just want to debug life together), hit me up!
